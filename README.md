# Audio_FG
Repository with Rscripts for triangulation and PAM density estimates of Guyanan red howlers. This includes scripts for localization using triangulation (hakken&plakken, acoustic triangulation) and scripts for density estimation using Point Count Distance Sampling. These scripts are marked with underscore PCDS. To run PCDS, first the scripts Hakken&Plakken_PCDS and audiostats_PCDS should be run, in subsequent order. 

The scripts Batch correlation, Script for Audiostats and WIP distance to power lm are written in collaboration with Thomas van Schaijk, the script acoustic_triangulation is written in collaboration with Yannick Wiegers and Thomas van Schaijk.
